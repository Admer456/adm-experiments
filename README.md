Currently there's just [OctreeExperiment](experiments/octree), but there will be more to come.  
This repository is a spiritual successor to [SoftRenda](https://github.com/Admer456/SoftRenda), which was never actually supposed to be a renderer, but rather, it was written for the purposes of visualisation.

That is, until I discovered [debug-draw](https://github.com/glampert/debug-draw). SoftRenda would get pretty choppy after maybe 2000 lines per frame or so, and there was no structure whatsoever. If I wanted to do something new, I'd have to either 

Some todos:
* quadtrees
* write TrenchBroom map loading code
* experiment with [JoltPhysics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics)
* ImGui
* port the raycasting stuff from SoftRenda
* port the BSP loading stuff from SoftRenda
